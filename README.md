# Quiz Master!
A simple web app that implements a question-answer platform with basic CRUD functions for the Question objects + added functionalities.

## Introduction
  In the creation of this exercise I intended to create a platform/app wherein I wanted it to be an 'open-source' way of learning. It's goal is to be able to improve stock knowledge through a wide array of topics provided by the community. A digestible bite of knowledge if you will. Afterall an approximate amount of knowledge may not lead us to the truth, but may very well make us closer to it.

## How to run
* To be added

## Recommendations/Improvements:
* Timer system per question - cause short and simple answers tend to improve muscle memory.
* Leaderboard - instead of sessions implement attempts on key-value storage.
* Turbolinks - under the time contraints I wasn't able to implement this. A better solution to having haml switching on the course of a quiz is an Ajax implementation.
* Improve UI/UX - I wanted the theme to be a dungeon crawler/indie game theme. This I believe will keep the focus and attention of users from a wider audience in terms of age. Also, game aesthetics never gets old.

##Specs:

* Ruby version => 2.4.1
* Rails version => '~> 5.1.6'
